| No. | Challenge | Solution
|-----|-----------|--------
|1. | Dynamic memory allocation of 2D arrays created segmentation faults| running the code in GDB helped find the line where the program crashes
|2. | Program crashes | Writing clean code with allocating and deallocating memory at all functions as per requirement|
|3. | Logical errors faced while designing matrix operations| Referred some articles to revise matrix basics and operations on 2D arrays
|4. | Unit testing on dynamic 2D array outputs| Created enumerated variables to be returned by those functions if the specified operation executes successfully
